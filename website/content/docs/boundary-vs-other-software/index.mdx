It can be difficult to understand how different software compare to each other. Is one a replacement for the other? Are they complementary? etc. In this section, we compare Boundary to other software.
We recommend also reading [â€œWhat is Boundary?"](/docs/what-is-boundary) and ["Why Boundary?"](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/why-we-built-hashicorp-boundary). These both will provide a better understanding of the problems that Boundary is trying to solve.

~> These comparisons _are not_ meant to convince you to use Boundary, and _are not_ meant to be negative towards other software. Our goal is only to provide a better understanding of how software does or does not overlap with Boundary, and where Boundary does things differently. If you believe any of the stated facts are incorrect, please open a GitHub Issue and we will resolve the inconsistency.
